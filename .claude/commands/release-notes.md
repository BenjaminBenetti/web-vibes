## Generate Release notes.

You will generate a new set of release notes for the user. These notes will be
based on inspecting the git history of the project since the tag $ARGUMENTS was
created. You will put these notes in the `/release` directory as a markdown
file.

#### Steps

1. Examine the git history up to the tag $ARGUMENTS
2. Create a new release notes file under the `/release` directory. Call the file
   `release-<next semantic tag>.md`
3. Using the information you get from the git history produce high level release
   notes in the markdown file.
4. Review the release notes to make sure they are appropriate for a user of the
   software and do not contain overly technical details.
