# Web Vibes Side Panel Migration

This document describes the migration from a popup-based Chrome extension to a side panel extension using Chrome's Side Panel API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Manifest Configuration
- Added `"sidePanel"` permission
- Removed `default_popup` from action and added `default_title`
- Added `side_panel` configuration with `default_path`
- Updated `web_accessible_resources` to include side panel files

### 2. Side Panel Implementation
- Created `sidepanel/` directory
- **sidepanel.html**: Main side panel HTML (ported from popup.html)
- **sidepanel.css**: Side panel specific styles for responsive layout
- **sidepanel.js**: Side panel JavaScript (ported from popup.js)

### 3. Key Differences from Popup

#### Navigation Behavior
- **Popup**: Used `window.location.href` for navigation
- **Side Panel**: Uses `chrome.tabs.create()` to open pages in new tabs

#### Layout Adjustments
- **Popup**: Fixed dimensions (400px width)
- **Side Panel**: Flexible width, full height, responsive design
- Added sticky header and flexible content area
- Improved mobile/narrow width handling

#### Event Handling
- Added tab change listeners to update content when switching between tabs
- Side panel persists across page navigations

### 4. Service Worker Updates
- Added `setupSidePanel()` method
- Configured `openPanelOnActionClick: true` for toolbar icon behavior

## Benefits of Side Panel

1. **Persistent UI**: Side panel stays open when navigating between tabs
2. **Better UX**: More space for content, better for complex interactions
3. **Modern Chrome API**: Uses latest Chrome extension capabilities
4. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different panel widths

## Usage

1. Install the extension
2. Click the extension icon in the toolbar to open the side panel
3. The side panel will show vibes for the current active tab
4. Content updates automatically when switching tabs

## Technical Notes

- Side panel requires Chrome 114+ and Manifest V3
- All popup functionality has been preserved and enhanced
- Original popup files remain for reference but are not used
- Chat and settings pages open in new tabs from the side panel
